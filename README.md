# SortingVisualizer

Decided to unite two of my greatest passions right now, data structures and algorithms, and game dev. I'm planning to build one of those sorting algorithms visualizers, implementing a couple of sorting algorithms and making it possible to visualize them for a better understanding.

I hope I can finish this project quickly, considering there will be little to no art production, but I intend to create clean and well-structured code. I'll also be documenting the entire development process via [this](https://sharing.clickup.com/12930081/b/h/4-90141459499-2/7ba0af62eec55f7) kanban board. Wish me luck.
